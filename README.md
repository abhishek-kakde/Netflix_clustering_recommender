## Netflix Recommender System and Clustering Project

Overview
This project implements a Netflix Recommender System and explores clustering techniques, including KMeans, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The recommender system suggests personalized movies or TV shows based on user preferences, while the clustering techniques help identify patterns and group similar content or users.

Business Context

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, I did

Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding what type content is available in different countries
If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.
Clustering similar content by matching text-based features




Main Libraries used:
Pandas for data manipulation, aggregation
Matplotlib,Seaborn and Plotly Express for visualization and behavior with respect to the target variable
NumPy for computationally efficient operations
Sklearn for models
